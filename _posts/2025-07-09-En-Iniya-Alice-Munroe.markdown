I recently had a chance to peruse Oliver Sacks' Letters edited by Kate Edgar. It is inspiring how much he litter his letters with literary references and how much he loves to read and write. He mentions as such in one such letters he writes to his parents. He would even go so far as to align his career paths to one where he can get more time to read and write. He reads a whole set of short stories of Henry James and devours Charles Darwin's autobiography in one day while basking in the sun in the NY's central park. It made me realize how little time I am spending on reading and relaxing. No time to stand beneath the boughs and read any old odes. Now is the time to correct this.
